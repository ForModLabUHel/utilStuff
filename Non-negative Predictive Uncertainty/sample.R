## marginal variances of 1.Thus the covariance matrix is the same as the correlation matrix in this context.

## FYI. A commen error here is 'Numerically negative definite covariance matrix' or
## 'Not positive definite'. That is an algebraic statement that some of the variables are
# linear combinations of one another. The covariance matrix is not positive definite because 
## it is singular. That means that at least one of those variables can be expressed as a linear combination of the others. 
## You do not need all the variables as the value of at least one can be determined from a subset of the others.
